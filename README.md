# Q8
![Alt text](imgs/main.jpg)
  
## Introduction
Q8 handheld is a very cheap device and the LCD screen sucks, just like shit. It is better for studying embedded system rather than play some games on this device. Now, I have ported Linux system (almost same as Miyoo) into this cheap device. If you are looking for Linux OS running on this device, here you can find all of resources you want. But the LCD model might be different with your Q8 device, so, I can't make sure whether it can run on your device or not. Anyway, follow the below steps to build a Linux system for your Q8 device. All of source code have been put on release page, enjoy !

## How to build Linux OS for Miyoo(Bittboy)  
### prepare environment
-  Debian 9 (x64)
-  download all of sources in release page
  
### configure toolchain
-  extract toolchain.7z into /opt/miyoo
-  export command
   -  export PATH=$PATH:/opt/miyoo/bin
  
### build uboot
-  boot from sdcard
   -  ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- make q8_sdcard_defconfig && ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- make -j8
  
### build kernel
-  ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- make q8_defconfig && ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- make zImage modules dtbs
  
### build boot.scr
-  mkimage -C none -A arm -T script -d boot.cmd boot.scr
  
### prepare sdcard (>= 4GB)
-  partition 1: 32MB FAT32 (boot.scr, dtb and zImage)
-  partition 2: 256MB EXT4 (rootfs)
-  partition 3: 256MB SWAP
-  partition 4: FAT32 (GMenu2X, config files and emulators)
  
### flash uboot:
-  boot from SDCard
   -  $ sudo dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=1024 seek=8
  
### flash kernel
-  copy boot.scr into partition 1
-  copy zImage into partition 1
-  copy suniv-f1c500s-miyoo.dtb into partition 1
-  copy r61520fb.ko into kernel folder in partition 2
-  copy daemon into kernel folder in partition 2
  
### build rootfs
-  download buildroot-2018.02.9 from https://buildroot.org
-  use config_buildroot-2018.02.9(in devel.zip) and then make it
-  toolchain location: /opt/miyoo
-  rootfs location: output/images/rootfs.tar
  
### flash rootfs
-  extract rootfs.tar into Partition 2
